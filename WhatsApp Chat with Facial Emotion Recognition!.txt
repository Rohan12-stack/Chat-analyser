27/02/25, 22:36 - Wifey❤️: Objective and Motivation

There are several areas where emotion recognition techniques are used, like in digital cameras to automatically take pictures when the user smiles.

However, the most promising applications involve the humanization of artificial intelligent systems. If computers are able to keep track of the mental state of the user, robots can react upon this and behave appropriately. Emotion recognition, therefore, plays a key role in improving human-machine interaction.

Focusing on the objective, using a neural network-based artificially intelligent system capable of deriving the emotion of a person through pictures of his or her face.

09/04/25, 23:29 - rohxn 03: @919663957450 Tasks
1. Get reference for FER using both CNN and ViT model(in this ppt we r comparing these 2 model which is better), so u need to find ppts based on that 

2. Ppt design part is completely ur responsibility, so search in google, canva, presentation.ai, like these websites and try to build a good looking ppt


3. Ill send our research paper or report, make it plagiarism free


4. Search in youtube for a good 3d game using unity see the first part and last part so u have an idea how the game looks like when playing, if u find it well sent the youtube link in group
09/04/25, 23:32 - Wifey❤️: Okayy
09/04/25, 23:33 - rohxn 03: @918799146002 Tasks

1. Help @919663957450 To make a ppt without tech error and content error, get more clarity on our problem statement(u can refer the research paper if u want) so u can help her create one

2. Try modifying the confusion matrix for better result (u can take ur time as its not a must now)

3. Search in youtube for a good 3d game using unity see the first part and last part so u have an idea how the game looks like when playing, if u find it well sent the youtube link in group
09/04/25, 23:35 - rohxn 03: @919663957450 Task 4 and @918799146002 Task 3
